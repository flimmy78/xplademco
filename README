xpladamco


xplademco is an xPL to Ademco gateway daemon which uses the Nutech ad2usb adapter to bridge an Ademco alarm panel to xPL.

The software attempts to follow the xPL security schema documented at xplrooject.org.uk, but due to limitations imposed by the data
sent from the Ademco panel, not all features are supported in the security schema.
